| Problem | Description | Links | Solution |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| [1] - Valid Parentheses | <p>Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.</p> | [Leetcode - Problem 20 - Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Parenthesis Checker](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/parenthesis-checker/0) | [Python](001_leetcode_P_020_ValidParentheses/Solution.py) |
| [2] - Next larger element | <p>Given an array A of size N having distinct elements,<br>the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.<br>If no such element exists, output -1.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks- Next larger element](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-larger-element/0) | [Python](002_geeksforgeeks_Next_Larger_Element/Solution.py) |
| [3] - Next Greater Element - I | <p>You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2, where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2.<br>Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.<br>The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2.<br>If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.</p> | [Leetcode - Problem 496 - Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/) | [Python](003_leetcode_P_496_NextGreaterElementPartOne/Solution.py) |
| [4] - Next Greater Element - II | <p>Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element.<br>The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array,<br>which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number.<br>If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.</p> | [Leetcode - Problem 503 - Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/) | [Python](004_leetcode_P_503_NextGreaterElementPartTwo/Solution.py) | 
| [5] - Implement Queue using Two Stacks | <p>Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.</p> | [Leetcode - Problem 232 - Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Queue using two Stacks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/queue-using-two-stacks/1) | [Python](005_leetcode_P_232_ImplementQueueUsingTwoStacks/Solution.py) |
