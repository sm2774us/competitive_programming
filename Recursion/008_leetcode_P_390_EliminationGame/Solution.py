# LeetCode - Problem - 390: Elimination Game
#
# Description:
#
# There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
#
# Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
#
# We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.
#
# Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
# n = 9,
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# 2 4 6 8
# 2 6
# 6
#
# Output:
# 6

# Solution Explanation
# **************************************************************************
# Basically we calculate the next starting point, and we go forward and backwards each time.
# Step gets multiplied by two at each loop iteration.
# Complexity is Î¸(log N) because we divide n by 2 at each iteration. Size complexity is O(1).
