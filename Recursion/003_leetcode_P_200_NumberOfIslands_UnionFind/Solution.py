# LeetCode - Problem - 200: Number of Islands
#
# Description:
#
# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water
# and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid
# are all surrounded by water.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
# ]
# Output: 1
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
# ]
# Output: 3

# **************************************************************************
# Solution Explanation:
# **************************************************************************
# The idea is based on Connected-component labeling, two-pass algorithm.
# Then use a set to get number of distinct label sets (number of islands)
