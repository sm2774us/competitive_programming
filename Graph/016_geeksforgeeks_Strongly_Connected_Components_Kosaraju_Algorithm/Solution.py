# GeeksForGeeks: Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's Algo)
#
# Description:
#
# Given a graph with N nodes and M directed edges. Your task is to complete the function kosaraju() which returns an integer denoting the number of strongly connected components in the graph.
#
# Input:
# The first line of input contains an integer T. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers N and M. In the next line there are M space-separated values u,v denoting an edge from u to v.
#
# Output:
# For each test case in a new line output will an integer denoting the no of strongly connected components present in the graph.
#
# Your Task:
# You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kosaraju() which takes the number of vertices V and adjacency list of the graph as inputs and returns an integer denoting the number of strongly connected components in the given graph.
#
# Expected Time Complexity: O(N + M).
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= T <= 100
# 1 <= N <= 5000
# 0 <= M <= (N*(N-1))
# 0 <= u, v <= N-1
# Sum of M over all testcases will not exceed 25*106
#
# Example:
# Input:
# 2
# 5 5
# 1 0 0 2 2 1 0 3 3 4
# 3 3
# 0 1 1 2 2 0
#
# Output:
# 3
# 1
#
# Explanation:
# Testcase 1:
# There is a connected subgraph that includes 0-1-2 which satisfy the condition of strongly connecting components i.e each node is reachable from every other nodes.
#
# Another subgraph includes individual nodes 4 and 3. That gives us a total of 3 subgraphs satisfying the condition of strongly connected components.
