# LeetCode - Problem 990: Satisfiability of Equality Equations
#
# Description:
#
# Given an array equations of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string equations[i] has length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "a==b" or "a!=b".  Here, a and b are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.
#
# Return true if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: ["a==b","b!=a"]
# Output: false
# Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: ["b==a","a==b"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]
# Output: true
# Example 4:
#
# Input: ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]
# Output: false
# Example 5:
#
# Input: ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]
# Output: true
#
# Note:
#
#   1. 1 <= equations.length <= 500
#   2. equations[i].length == 4
#   3. equations[i][0] and equations[i][3] are lowercase letters
#   4. equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'
#   5. equations[i][2] is '='

# Method 3: Union Find
#
# - for each equation,
#       + if it is an inquality,
#           [] then add it to 'check' (a list that we use to check the validility of the input later)
#       + else:
#           [] union the two expression
#
# After we find all connnected components, we can simply check if the lhs and rhs of each inequality in 'check' is in the same connected components.
#
# If they are, then they must be equal and therefore the inequality should not hold, so we return 'False'.
