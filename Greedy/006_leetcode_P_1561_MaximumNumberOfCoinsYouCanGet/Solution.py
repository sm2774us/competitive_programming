# LeetCode - Problem 1561: Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get
#
# Description:
#
# There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:
#
# In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
# Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
# You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
# Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
# Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
# Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.
#
# Return the maximum number of coins which you can have.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
# Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
# The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
# On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: piles = [2,4,5]
# Output: 4
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: piles = [9,8,7,6,5,1,2,3,4]
# Output: 18
#
# Constraints:
#
# 3 <= piles.length <= 10^5
# piles.length % 3 == 0
# 1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4

# Solution Explanation
# **************************************************************************
#
# Intuition
# We want to compare the numbers, we need to sort.
# We give the smallest values Bob,
# give the biggest to Alice,
# and leave the second biggest to us.
# Then we repeat this process.
#
#
# Explanation
# We give small value to Bob,
# give the large value to Alice,
# and we pick the medium values.
#
# The final assignment will be like:
# S S S S S S M L M L M L M L M L
#
# The first third part is given to Bob,
# start from A[n/3], we pick one element from every two.
#
#
# Complexity
# Time O(sort)  => O(NlogN)
# Space O(sort) => O(N)
#
# Each time pick the remaining largest 2 and the smallest one to form a triple, choose the 2nd largest
# out of the triplet, repeats till the end;
# Therefore, we can simply sort the array and choose the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ..., from the largest, till we have n / 3 piles.
# We can equally start from the (piles.length / 3 + 1)th pile, followed by (piles.length / 3 + 3)th,
# (piles.length / 3 + 5)th, ..., till the end of the array piles.
