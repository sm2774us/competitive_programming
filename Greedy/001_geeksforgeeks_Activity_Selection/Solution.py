# GeeksForGeeks - Activity Selection
#
# Description:
#
# Given N activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.
#
# Note : The start time and end time of two activities may coincide.
#
# Input:
# The first line contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases. First line is N number of activities then second line contains N numbers which are starting time of activies.Third line contains N finishing time of activities.
#
# Output:
# For each test case, output a single number denoting maximum activites which can be performed in new line.
#
# Constraints:
# 1<=T<=50
# 1<=N<=1000
# 1<=A[i]<=100
#
# Example:
# Input:
# 2
# 6
# 1 3 2 5 8 5
# 2 4 6 7 9 9
# 4
# 1 3 2 5
# 2 4 3 6
#
# Output:
# 4
# 4
#
# Explanation:
# Test Case 1: The following activities can be performed (in the same order):
# (1, 2)
# (3, 4)
# (5, 7)
# (8, 9)
