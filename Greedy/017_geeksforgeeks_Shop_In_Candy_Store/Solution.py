# GeeksForGeeks - Shop in Candy Store
#
# Description:
#
# In a candy store there are N different types of candies available  and the prices of all the N different types of candies are provided to you.
# You are now provided with an attractive offer.
# You can buy a single candy from the store and get atmost K other candies ( all are different types ) for free.
# Now you have to answer two questions. Firstly, you have to tell what is the minimum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies. Secondly, you have to tell what is the maximum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies.
# In both the cases you must utilize the offer i.e. you buy one candy and get K other candies for free.
#
#
# Input
# The first line of the input contains T the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains the values of N and K as described above.  Then in the next line N integers follow denoting the price of each of the N different candies.
#
#
# Output
# For each test case output a single line containing 2 space separated integers , the first denoting the minimum amount of money required to be spent and the second denoting the maximum amount of money to be spent.
# Remember to output the answer of each test case in a new line.
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= T <= 50
# 1 <= N <= 1000
#  0 <= K <= N-1
# 1 <= Ai <= 100
#
#
# Expected Time Complexity : O(nlogn)
#
# Example:
# Input
#  1
#  4  2
#  3 2 1 4
#
# Output
#  3 7
#
# Explanation
# As according to the offer if you but one candy you can take atmost two more for free.
# So in the first case you buy the candy which costs 1 and take candies worth 3 and 4 for free, also you buy candy worth 2 as well.
# So min cost = 1+2 =3.
# In the second case I buy the candy which costs 4 and take candies worth 1 and 2 for free, also I  buy candy worth 3 as well.
# So max cost = 3+4 =7.
