The task is to return the position of **first set bit found** from the right side in the binary representation of the number.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Find first set bit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-set-bit-1587115620/1) | [Python](001_geeksforgeeks_Find_First_Set_Bit_AKA_Find_Index_Of_LSB/Solution.py) |
| [2] - Rightmost different bit | <p>Given two numbers **M** and **N**. The task is to find the position of the **rightmost different** bit in the binary representation of numbers.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Rightmost different bit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rightmost-different-bit-1587115621/1) | [Python](002_geeksforgeeks_Rightmost_Different_Bit/Solution.py) |
