## Bit Magic

| Problem | Description | Links | Solution |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| [1] - Find first set bit AKA Find Index of **LSB** - (<ins>**L**</ins>east <ins>**S**</ins>ignificant <ins>**B**</ins>it) | <p>Given an integer an **N**. The task is to return the position of **first set bit found** from the right side in the binary representation of the number.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Find first set bit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-set-bit-1587115620/1) | [Python](001_geeksforgeeks_Find_First_Set_Bit_AKA_Find_Index_Of_LSB/Solution.py) |
| [2] - Rightmost different bit | <p>Given two numbers **M** and **N**. The task is to find the position of the **rightmost different** bit in the binary representation of numbers.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Rightmost different bit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rightmost-different-bit-1587115621/1) | [Python](002_geeksforgeeks_Rightmost_Different_Bit/Solution.py) |
| [3] - Check whether K-th bit is set or not | <p>Given a number **N** and a bit number **K**, check if **K<sup>th</sup>** bit of N is **set or not**. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be **indexed starting with 0** from **LSB** side in binary representation of the number.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Check whether K-th bit is set or not](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-whether-k-th-bit-is-set-or-not-1587115620/1) | [Python](003_geeksforgeeks_Check_Whether_K-th_Bit_Is_Set_Or_Not/Solution.py) |
| [4] - Toggle bits given range | <p>Given a non-negative number **n** and two values **L** and **R**. The problem is to toggle the bits in the range **L** to **R** in the binary representation of **n**, i.e, to toggle bits from the rightmost **L<sup>th</sup>** bit to the rightmost **R<sup>th</sup>** bit. A toggle operation flips a bit 0 to 1 and a bit 1 to 0. Print **n** after the bits are toggled.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Toggle bits given range](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/toggle-bits-given-range0952/1) | [Python](004_geeksforgeeks_Toggle_Bits_Given_Range/Solution.py) |
| [5] - Set kth bit  | <p>Given a number **N** and a value **K**. From the right, set the Kth bit in the binary representation of N. The position of Least Significant Bit(or last bit) is 0, the second last bit is 1 and so on.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Set kth bit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-kth-bit3724/1) | [Python](005_geeksforgeeks_Set_kth_Bit/Solution.py) |
| [6] - Power of 2 | <p>Given a positive integer **N**. The task is to check if **N** is a power of **2**. More formally, check if **N** can be expressed as **2<sup>x</sup>** for some **x**.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Power of 2](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/power-of-2-1587115620/1) | [Python](006_geeksforgeeks_Power_Of_2/Solution.py) |
| [7] - Bit Difference | <p>You are given two numbers **A** and **B**. The task is to **count the number of bits needed to be flipped** to **convert** A to B.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Bit Difference](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/bit-difference-1587115620/1) | [Python](007_geeksforgeeks_Bit_Difference/Solution.py) |
| [8] - Rotate Bits | <p>Given an integer **N** and an integer **D**,<br>you are required to write a program to **rotate the binary representation** of the integer **N by D** digits to the **left** as well as **right** and print the **results** in **decimal values** after each of the rotation.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Rotate Bits](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-bits/0) | [Python](008_geeksforgeeks_Rotate_Bits/Solution.py) |
| [9] - Swap all odd and even bits | <p>Given an unsigned integer **N**.<br>The task is to swap all odd bits with even bits.<br>For example, if the given number is 23 (**0**0**0**1**0**1**1**1), it should be converted to 43(0**0**1**0**1**0**1**1**).<br>Here, every even position bit is swapped with adjacent bit on right side(even position bits are highlighted in binary representation of 23),<br>and every odd position bit is swapped with adjacent on left side.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Swap all odd and even bits](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/swap-all-odd-and-even-bits/0) | [Python](009_geeksforgeeks_Swap_All_Odd_And_Even_Bits/Solution.py) |
| [10] - Count Total Set Bits | <p>You are given a number **N**.<br>Find the **total count of set bits** for all numbers from 1 to N(both inclusive).</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Count total set bits](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-total-set-bits-1587115620/1) | [Python](010_geeksforgeeks_Count_Set_Bits/Solution.py) |
| [11] - Longest Consecutive 1's | <p>Given a number **N**. The task is to find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Longest Consecutive 1's](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-consecutive-1s-1587115620/1) | [Python](011_geeksforgeeks_Longest_Consecutive_Ones/Solution.py) |
| [12] - Binary Number with Alternating Bits AKA Sparse Number | <p>Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.</p> | [LeetCode - Problem 693 - Binary Number with Alternating Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-number-with-alternating-bits/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Number is sparse or not](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-is-sparse-or-not-1587115620/1) | [Python](012_leetcode_P_693_BinaryNumberWithAlternatingBits_AKA_SparseNumber/Solution.py) |
| [13] - Party of Couples | <p>In a party of N people, each person is denoted by an integer. Couples are represented by the same number. Find out the only singe person in the party of couples.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Party of Couples](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/alone-in-couple5507/1) | [Python](013_geeksforgeeks_Party_Of_Couples/Solution.py) |
| [14] - Maximum subset XOR | <p>Given a set of positive integers. The task is to complete the function **maxSubarrayXOR** which returns an integer denoting the maximum XOR subset value in the given set.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Maximum subset XOR](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-subset-xor/1) | [Python](014_geeksforgeeks_Maximum_Subset_XOR/Solution.py) |
