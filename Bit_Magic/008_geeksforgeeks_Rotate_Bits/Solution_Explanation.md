#
# Description:
#
# Given an integer N and an integer D, you are required to write a program to rotate the binary representation of the integer N by D digits to the left as well as right and print the results in decimal values after each of the rotation.
# Note: Integer N is stored using 16 bits. i.e. 12 will be stored as 0000.....001100.
#
# Input:
# First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. Each test case contains two space separated integers N and D where N denotes the number to be rotated and D denotes the number of digits by which the number is required to be rotated.
#
# Output:
# For each testcase, in a new line, print the value of number N after rotating it to left by D digits in one line, and second line prints the value of number N after rotating it to the right by D digits.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= T <= 100
# 1 <= N <  216
# 1 <= D <= 105
#
# Example:
# Input:
# 2
# 229 3
# 28 2
# Output:
# 1832
# 40988
# 112
# 7
