# GeeksForGeeks: Set kth bit
#
# Description:
#
# Given a number N and a value K. From the right, set the Kth bit in the binary representation of N.
# The position of Least Significant Bit(or last bit) is 0, the second last bit is 1 and so on.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# N = 10
# K = 2
# Output:
# 14
# Explanation:
# Binary representation of the given number
# 10 is: 1 0 1 0, number of bits in the
# binary reprsentation is 4. Thus 2nd bit
# from right is 0. The number after changing
# this bit to 1 is: 14(1 1 1 0).
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# N = 15
# K = 3
# Output:
# 15
# Explanation:
# The binary representation of the given
# number 15 is: 1 1 1 1, number of bits
# in the binary representation is 4. Thus
# 3rd bit from the right is 1. The number
# after changing this bit to 1 is
# 15(1 1 1 1).
# Your Task:
# You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function setKthBit() which takes two integer N and K as input parameter and returns an integer after setting the K'th bit in N.
#
# Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
#
# Constraints:
#   * 1 <= N <= 109
#   * 0 <= K < X, where X is the number of bits in the binary representation of N.
