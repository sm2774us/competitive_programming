# GeeksForGeeks: Check whether K-th bit is set or not
#
# Description:
#
# Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
# Example, Consider N = 4(100):  0th bit = 0, 1st bit = 0, 2nd bit = 1.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: N = 4, K = 0
# Output: false
# Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100,
# in which 0th bit from LSB is not set.
# So, return false.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: N = 4, K = 2
# Output: true
# Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100,
# in which 2nd bit from LSB is set.
# So, return true.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: N = 500, K = 3
# Output: false
# Explanation: Binary representation of 500 is
# 111110100, in which 3rd bit from LSB is not set.
# So, return false.
#
# Your Task:  This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function checkKthbit that takes n and k as parameters and returns either true (if kth bit is set) or false(if kth bit is not set).
#
# Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
#
# Constraints:
#   * 1 ≤ N ≤ 109
#   * 0 ≤ K ≤ floor(log2(N) + 1)
