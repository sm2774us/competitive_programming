# LeetCode - Problem 298: Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence
#
# Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.
#
# The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).
#
# For example,
#
#    1
#     \
#      3
#     / \
#    2   4
#         \
#          5
# Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
#
#    2
#     \
#      3
#     /
#    2
#   /
#  1
# Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3,not 3-2-1, so return 2.

    # We can solve above problem recursively.
    # 1) At each node we need information of its parent node, if current node has value one more than
    #    its parent node then it makes a consecutive path,
    #    at each node we will compare nodeâ€™s value with its parent value and
    #    update the longest consecutive path accordingly.
    # 2) For getting the value of parent node, we will pass the (node_value + 1)
    #    as an argument to the recursive method and compare the node value
    #    with this argument value,
    #    if satisfied, update the current length of consecutive path
    #    otherwise reinitialize current path length by 1.
