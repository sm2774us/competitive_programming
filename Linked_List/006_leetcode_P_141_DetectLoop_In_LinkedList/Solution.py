# LeetCode - Problem - 141: Linked List Cycle
#
# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
#
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously
# following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next
# pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
#
# Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
#
# Follow up:
#
# Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
#
# Example 1:
#    ___         ___         ___         ___
#  /     \     /     \     /     \     /     \
# |   3   |-->|   2   |-->|   0   |-->|  -4   |
#  \ ___ /     \ ___ /     \ ___ /     \ ___ / \
#                 +                             |
#                /|\                            |
#                 +-----------------------------+
#
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
#
# Example 2:
#    ___         ___
#  /     \     /     \
# |   1   |-->|   2   |
#  \ ___ /     \ ___ / \
#     +                 |
#    /|\                |
#     +-----------------+
#
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
#
# Example 3:
#    ___
#  /     \
# |   1   |
#  \ ___ /
#
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
#
# Constraints:
#
#   * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
#   * -105 <= Node.val <= 105
#   * pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

# Solution Explanation
# **************************************************************************
# Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm
# **************************************************************************
# This is the fastest method to solve this problem and has been described below:
#   * Traverse linked list using two pointers.
#   * Move one pointer(slow) by one and another pointer(fast) by two.
#   * If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list
#     doesnâ€™t have a loop.
#   * Below image shows how the detectloop function works in the code :
