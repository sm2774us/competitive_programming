| [1] - Single Element in a Sorted Array | <p>You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.<br>Find this single element that appears only once.</p> | [LeetCode - Problem 540 - Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Find the element that appears once in sorted array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-element-that-appears-once-in-sorted-array0624/1) | [Python](001_leetcode_P_540_SingleElementInASortedArray/Solution.py) |
| [2] - Search in Rotated Sorted Array | <p>You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`.<br>Suppose that `nums` is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).<br>If `target` is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return `-1`.</p> | [LeetCode - Problem 33 - Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Search in a Rotated Array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-rotated-array/0) | [Python](002_leetcode_P_033_SearchInRotatedSortedArray/Solution.py) |
| [3] - Binary Search | <p>Given a **sorted** (in ascending order) integer array `nums` of `n` elements and a `target` value, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index, otherwise return `-1`.</p> | [LeetCode - Problem 704 - Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Binary Search](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-search/1) | [Python](003_leetcode_P_704_BinarySearch/Solution.py) |
| [4] - Sum of Middle Elements of two sorted arrays | <p>Given 2 sorted arrays `A` and `B` of size `N` each.<br>Print sum of middle elements of the array obtained after merging the given arrays.</p> | [GeeksForGeeks - Sum of Middle Elements of two sorted arrays](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-middle-elements-of-two-sorted-arrays/0) | [Python](004_geeksforgeeks_Sum_Of_Middle_Elements_Of_Two_Sorted_Arrays/Solution.py) |
| [5] - Median of two sorted arrays | <p>Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.<br>**Follow up:** The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.</p> | [LeetCode - Problem 4 - Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Median of two sorted arrays of different sizes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-of-different-sizes/) | [Python](005_leetcode_P_004_MedianOfTwoSortedArrays/Solution.py) |
| [6] - Quick Sort | <p>Quick Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.<br>It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.<br>Given an array `arr[]`, its starting position `low` and its ending position `high`.<br>Implement the partition() function used in quickSort().</p> | [LeetCode - Problem 912 - Sort an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Quick Sort](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/quick-sort/1) | [Python](006_leetcode_P_912_SortAnArray_QuickSort/Solution.py) |
| [7] - Merge Sort | <p>Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.<br>It repeatedly divides the array into two halves and combines them in sorted manner.<br>Given an array `arr[]`, its starting position `l` and its ending position `r`.<br>Implement the merge() function used in MergeSort()..</p> | [LeetCode - Problem 912 - Sort an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - Merge Sort](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-sort/1) | [Python](007_leetcode_P_912_SortAnArray_MergeSort/Solution.py) |
| [8] - Google - Phone Screen - Kth Largest Element of Two Sorted Arrays AKA K-th element of two sorted Arrays | <p>Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively and an int `k`.<br>Find the `k-th` largest element of these arrays.<br>Note that it is the `k-th` largest element in the sorted order, not the `k-th` distinct element.</p> | [Google - Phone Screen - Kth Largest Element of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/351782/Google-or-Phone-Screen-or-Kth-Largest-Element-of-Two-Sorted-Arrays)<br>[GeeksForGeeks - K-th element of two sorted Arrays](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-th-element-of-two-sorted-array/0) | [Python](008_google_PhoneScreen_Kth_Largest_Element_of_Two_Sorted_Arrays/Solution.py) |
