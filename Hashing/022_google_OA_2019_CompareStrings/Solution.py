#
# One string is strictly smaller than another when the frequency of occurrence of the smallest character in the
# string is less than the frequency of occurrence of the smallest character in the comparison string.
#
# For example, string "abcd" is smaller than string "aaa" because the smallest character (in lexicographical order)
# in "abcd" is 'a', with a frequency of 1, and the smallest character in "aaa" is also 'a', but with a frequency of 3.
# In another example, string "a" is smaller than string "bb" because the smallest character in "a" is 'a' with a
# frequency of 1, and the smallest character in "bb" is 'b' with a frequency of 2.
#
# Write a function that, given string A (which contains M strings delimited by ',') and string B (which contains N
# strings delimited by ','), returns an array C of N integers. For 0 <= J < N, values of C[J] specify the number of
# strings in A which are strictly smaller than the comparison J-th string in B (starting from 0).
#
# For example, given strings A and B such that:
# A = "abcd aabc bd"
# B = "aaa aa"
#
# The function should return [3, 2] because:
#
# All the strings in the array are strictly smaller than "aaa" on the basis of the given comparison criteria;
#
# Strings "abcd" and "bd" are strictly smaller than "aa".
#
# Assume that:
#   * 1 <= N, M <= 10000
#   * 1 <= length of any string contained by A or B <= 10
#   * All the input strings comprise only lowercase English alphabet letters (a-z)
#
# In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the primary focus of the
# assessment.
