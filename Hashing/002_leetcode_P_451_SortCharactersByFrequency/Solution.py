# LeetCode - Problem - 451: Sort Characters By Frequency
#
# Description:
#
# Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# "tree"
#
# Output:
# "eert"
#
# Explanation:
# 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
# So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# "cccaaa"
#
# Output:
# "cccaaa"
#
# Explanation:
# Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
# Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input:
# "Aabb"
#
# Output:
# "bbAa"
#
# Explanation:
# "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
# Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

# Solution Explanation
# **************************************************************************
# 1) Frequency of a character can vary from 0 to len(s).
# 2) Create a hashmap H1 of character to character frequency for the input string.
# 3) Iterate H1 to create hashmap H2 with key as frequency and value as substrings of repeated strings with length as the frequency.
# 4) Finally lookup all potential frequencies in decreasing order in H2 and produce the final result.
