# LeetCode - Problem 1143: Longest Common Subsequence
#
# Description:
#
# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
#
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted
# without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde"
# while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
#
# If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
#
#
# Constraints:
#   * 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
#   * 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
#   * The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
