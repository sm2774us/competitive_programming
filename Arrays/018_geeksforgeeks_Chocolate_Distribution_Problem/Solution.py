# Chocolate Distribution Problem
# **************************************************************************
# Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet.
# Each packet can have variable number of chocolates.
# There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
#
# 1. Each student gets one packet.
# 2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with maximum chocolates
#    and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
#   A = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12] ( each value represents the # of chocolates in a packet )
#   M = 5 ( # of students )
# Output: 6
#
# Explanation:
# The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 9-3=6
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
#   A = [7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56] ( each value represents the # of chocolates in a packet )
#   M = 3 ( # of students )
# Output: 2
