# Description:
#
# The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N.
# Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
# Output: [ (0, 3), (4, 6) ]
# Explanation: We can buy stock on day 0, and sell it on 3rd day, which will give us maximum profit.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
# Output: [ (1, 4), (5, 9) ]
