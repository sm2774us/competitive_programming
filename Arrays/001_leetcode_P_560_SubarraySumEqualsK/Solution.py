# Description:
#
# Given an array of integers and an integer k,
# you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays
# whose sum equals to k.
#
# For example,
#  Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
#  Output: 2
#
# Constraints:
#   1) The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
#   2) The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

# Algorithm Complexity Explanation
# **************************************************************************
# Time : O(N)
# **************************************************************************
# The time complexity is O(N): it just goes through each element in the input array for once only
# and with the loop each operation is O(1).
#
# **************************************************************************
# Space : O(N)
# **************************************************************************
# When it comes to space complexity: there is a hashmap/dictionary which can scale (in worse case)
# with the size of input array,
# so it can take up to O(N) space and hence the space complexity is O(N).
#
# **************************************************************************
# Explanation
# **************************************************************************
#
# First of all, the basic idea behind this code is that, whenever the sums has increased by a value of k,
# we've found a subarray of sums=k.
# I'll also explain why we need to initialise a 0 in the hashmap [ in python we can use a defaultdict(int)  for this ].
# Example: Let's say our elements are [1,2,1,3] and k = 3.
# and our corresponding running sums = [1,3,4,7]
# Now, if you notice the running sums array, from 1->4, there is increase of k and from 4->7,
# there is an increase of k.
# So, we've found 2 subarrays of sums=k.
#
# But, if you look at the original array, there are 3 subarrays of sums==k.
# Now, you'll understand why 0 comes in the picture.
#
# In the above example, 4-1=k and 7-4=k. Hence, we concluded that there are 2 subarrays.
# However, if sums==k, it should've been 3-0=k. But 0 is not present in the array.
# To account for this case, we include the 0.
# Now the modified sums array will look like [0,1,3,4,7]. Now, try to see for the increase of k.
#
# 0->3
# 1->4
# 4->7
# Hence, 3 sub arrays of sums=k
