#
# Given an array of positive integers. The task is to find inversion count of array.
#
# Inversion Count Definition:
# For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array
# is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0.
# If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.
# Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.
#
# Example:
#
# Given input            => [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
#       output should be => 3
#
# Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
# 1 ≤ N ≤ 107
# 1 ≤ C ≤ 1018
#
# **************************************************************************
#
# Explanation
#
# Given input            => X = [2,1,6], Y = [1,5], m = 3, n = 2
#       output should be => 3
#                           The pairs which follow xy > yx are as such: 2^1 > 1^2,  2^5 > 5^2 and 6^1 > 1^6

# Solution Explanation:
# **************************************************************************
# Hint: Use a Binary Indexed Tree, aka a Fenwick tree
# https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/binary-indexed-trees/
# We often need some sort of data structure to make our algorithms faster. In this article we will discuss about the
# Binary Indexed Trees structure, proposed by Peter M. Fenwick.
# This structure was first used for data compression, by Peter M. Fenwick.
# In algorithmic contests it is often used for storing frequencies and manipulating cumulative frequency tables.
#
# **************************************************************************
# You can use one to maintain prefix sums on the values of your permutation elements.
# Then you can just proceed from right to left and count for every element
# the number of elements smaller than it to the right.
#
# Uses the built-in sort to determine the ranking of array items, and a Binary Indexed Tree (aka Fenwick tree)
# to store the cumulative sums required to calculate the inversion count.
# **************************************************************************
# Another possible solution for smaller list sizes ( which ends being faster for list sizes under 40,000 or so ) is:
# **************************************************************************
# Another Python solution, short one.
# Makes use of builtin bisect module, which provides functions to insert element into its place
# in sorted array and to find index of element in sorted array.
#
# The idea is to store elements left of n-th in such array, which would allow us
# to easily find the number of them greater than n-th.
#
# "i & -i" - this is clear all bits "1", but last significant one. For example:
#
#         <2's complement binary integer>      <decimal representation of 2's complement>
#      i: 0b1101001010000000                => (-11648)dec10
#     -i: 0b0010110110000000                => (11648)dec10
# i & -i: 0b0000000010000000                => (128)dec10
#
#      i: 0b11010010 1 0000000
#     -i: 0b00101101 1 0000000
# i & -i: 0b00000000 1 0000000
#
# i(dec)   i(bin)     i&-i
#  1            1        1
#  5          101        1
#  8         1000     1000
# 12         1100     0100
